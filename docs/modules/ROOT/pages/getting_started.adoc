== Getting Started

In this section we walk you through necessary steps to start using `ike`. It just takes few minutes and you are ready to start coding!

=== What do you need

* [x] `oc` or `kubectl`
* [x] https://www.telepresence.io/reference/install[Telepresence] CLI tool (and required runtime dependencies)
* [x] Ike binary


=== Using `ike` CLI

[source,bash]
----

ike develop --deployment details-v1 --port 9080 --watch --run 'ruby details.rb 9080' --route header:end-user=alien-ike
----

Now you have process based on your local code base which proxies connections to your Kubernetes cluster! Have fun hacking!

NOTE: `// TODO add screencast showing the basic flow`

NOTE: `// TODO add sources to our binary once released`

NOTE: `// TODO single install script`
